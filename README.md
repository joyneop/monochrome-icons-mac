## Core Bundle

The files inside `corebundle` shall be pasted to `/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Resources`. It is extremely recommended to back up all ICNS files in the directory before overriding existing files in the destination directory.

## And the rest

Everyone knows how to replace the icon of an app or file so I won't waste my time on explaining.
